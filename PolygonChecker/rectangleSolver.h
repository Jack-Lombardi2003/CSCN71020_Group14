//Write a program with 2 functionalities:
//1. Accept 3 user input numbers, check if they make a triangle, and if they do, display what type of triangle it is 
//and calculate and display the inside angles between the sides.
//2. Accept 4 user input points as x/y pairs (x, y), generate lines between the points and determine if they form a rectangle.
//Report the perimiter of the shape, and if it is a rectangle, report the area. To create the rectangle, 
//determine which corner each point is by calculation, then connect each corner in order. This eliminates the possibility of lines crossing.
